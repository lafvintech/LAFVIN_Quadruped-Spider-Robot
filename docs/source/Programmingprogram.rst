Flash The Firmware
===================

**The kit is shipped without firmware preloaded, so no response after power-up is normal. Follow the steps below to program the spider robot and make it move.**

**We provide two methods for flashing firmware; you can choose the method that suits you best.**

----

.. _Install Serial Port Tool:

Install Serial Port Tool
------------------------

This kit uses an ESP8266 board with a CP2102 USB-to-UART bridge. Ensure the CP2102 driver is installed on your computer before connecting the board, or the serial port will not be detected. Connect the board, press Win+X to open Device Manager, and verify the driver is installed. If not, use the link below to download and install it.

.. note::
   
   If flashing fails, please check the following:

   - The USB cable and USB port are functional; try another cable or port.
   - The ESP8266 board is powered and enters download mode correctly.
   - The selected serial port is correct and not being used by other software.
   - The CP2102 driver is installed and recognized in Device Manager.
   - The firmware file is selected correctly and the flash settings match the board (baud rate, flash mode, etc.).

   If the issue persists, reboot your computer, restart the board, and retry.

.. note::

   If the flashing process fails, please follow these steps:

   - Confirm that the ESP32 development board is properly connected to the computer via a USB cable and that the CH340 driver is installed.
   - Check that COMx in the flashing tool is the actual serial port number.
   - Confirm that the firmware file is correctly placed in the BIN folder and check the box on the left.
   - Verify the flashing parameter settings: SPI SPEED = 80MHz, SPI MODE = DIO, BAUD = 921600.
   - Try changing the USB cable or USB port to eliminate communication issues.
   - If flashing still fails, restart the computer and development board and try again.
